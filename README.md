MediaConverter
==============

Media Converter is a simple and easy to use media conversion and transcoding app written entirely in Java.
This app makes use of the popular [**__ffmpeg__**](http://ffmpeg.org "FFMpeg Project Homepage") utility. With ffmpeg you can be assured about the quality and versatility of the program.
ffmpeg is the same program which powers many popular applications such as VLC Media Player, Google Chrome, MPlayer etc. This program also makes use of the [Apache Commons Exec API](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-exec/) and little use of [Apache Commons IO API](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/)

As you might have guessed, to build this project, you need:
* Netbeans IDE (We Netbeans IDE 8)
* Java JDK (We've used JDK 8, but JDK 6+ will work)
* Apache Commons API (can be downloaded from link above)
* Prebuilt binanries of ffmpeg
